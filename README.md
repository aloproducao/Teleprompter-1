## Teleprompter

This is a little [React App](https://reactjs.org/) that help you edit closed captions for a video.

Simply load the SRT file that you want to test, an SRT file looks like this:

```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,405
>> Hello everyone, and
welcome to today's webinar.

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:07,455
Before we begin, we want to
cover a few housekeeping items.
...
```

then load the video from a web URL using the input box on the left, as the video plays the SRT
prompt will scroll in sync with the video.

If you find any errors, simply correct them as you go.  When you are finished, click the
Save Button to download the updated SRT or click the copy button to copy the new SRT text
to your clipboard.

## React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
